# Rock-Paper-Scissors Circuit
This is a university project with the aim of designing and modeling a circuit that governs the rock-paper-scissors game.
In this repository, I use two different "modeling languages" to create the circuit:
- [SIS](https://bettersis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorials.html)
- [Verilog](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog)
